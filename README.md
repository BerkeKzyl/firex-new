- Raspberry Pi (for sensor deployment)

### Web Application Setup
```bash
cd firex-new
npm install
npm run dev
```

### iOS Application Setup
1. Open `FireXIOS/FireXIOS.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Install dependencies using CocoaPods
3. Build and run the application

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd firex-new
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### IoT Setup
```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure sensor settings
python configure_sensors.py
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `firex-new` directory with the following variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_key
```

### Sensor Configuration
Configure sensor settings in `firex-new/config.json`:
```json
{
  "sensors": {
    "dht22": {
      "pin": 4,
      "interval": 300
    },
    "mq9": {
      "pin": 17,
      "interval": 60
    },
    "gps": {
      "port": "/dev/ttyAMA0",
      "baudrate": 9600
    }
  }
}
```
